## Features

- Manipulation

Fermion is all about ease of use and speed. Drag and drop, resize, and nest your components to prototype your app layout.

- Configuration

Configure your components in real-time. Fermion allows you to apply style and add event-handling to your components.

- Preview

Fermion leverages webpack to create a live preview of your new prototype. Simply export your project and our simulator will display how your project will look in the browser.

- Exporting

Once you are done prototyping, the real fun begins! Fermion exports your prototype along with all of your configurations as working code so that you can continue to refine your project in the setting of your choice.
